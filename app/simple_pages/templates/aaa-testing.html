                <h5 class="card-title">What is AAA Testing?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern has become almost a standard across the industry. 
                    It suggests that you should divide your test method into three sections: arrange, act and assert. 
                    Each one of them only responsible for the part in which they are named after.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Arrange</strong> part is where we set up our environment, i.e. everything we need to run our test code. 
                    This includes initializing objects, dependencies, and all data required for the test case.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Act</strong> part is where we execute the test by calling the functions set up in the previous step.</p>
                <p>Finally, the <strong>Assert</strong> part is where we specify the pass criteria for the test, which fails it if not met,
                    i.e. if the actual results of the test donâ€™t match those we expected.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Why testing is important?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Unit testing allows software developers to actually think through the design of the 
                    software and what has to be done before they write the code.
                     This can help them to stay focused and can also help them to create much better designs.</p>

                <p>Developers write unit tests for their code to make sure that the code works correctly. 
                     This helps to detect and protect against bugs in the future. Sometimes developers write unit tests first,
                      then write the code. This approach is also known as test-driven development (TDD).</p>
